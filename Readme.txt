Hello everyone!

This is a machine learning project that uses NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras to classify images.
The Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 28x28 pixel grayscale images that represent ten various 
categories of apparel items, including t-shirts, pants, sneakers, dresses, and more.

I trained on 10 epochs using the sparse crosscategorical entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
I used Matplotlib to display the images after using Keras Sequential Layers to build the model.
